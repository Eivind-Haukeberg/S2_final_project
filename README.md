# S2_Final_Project â€“ OneApp

OneApp is a streaming platform that allows users to watch movie and TV show collections, as well as add content to their own list.
This project was developed as the final assignment for the **FFU1200 Frontend Development** course. It is a web application called **OneApp**, which integrates external API data from TMDB, user authentication, a personalized list feature, and admin-level interaction with a Firebase backend. The goal was to use **React**, **responsive design**, **React Router**, **Firebase**, **form validation**, and **component architecture**. This README was drafted with the help of ChatGPT and refined by the author.
