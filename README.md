This project was developed as the final assignment for the **FFU1200 Frontend Development** course. It is a web application called **OneApp**, which integrates external API data from TMDB, user authentication, a personalized list feature, and admin-level interaction with a Firebase backend. The goal was to use **React**, **responsive design**, **React Router**, **Firebase**, **form validation**, and **component architecture**. This README was drafted with the help of ChatGPT and refined by the author.
